ESP32 Setup Git Repository Link: https://github.com/blake-budd1/esp32_setup

At the current present, we have the code we have been working on so far stored either locally or in the ESP32 SetUp Git Repository. We have so far managed to enable our device to connect as well as have figured out how to allow our device to generate its own wifi connection. Additionally, we have set up the initial connection between the ESP32 and the TFT display we currently have using LVGL. At the present, we are able to run the demo images currently available that has been provided to us. 

 Current, existing bugs deal with implementing our own images with the TFT display.
