# TheModernJukebox

## Project Description
### Problem Statement
When at a get together with friends there is no way for individuals with different music streaming services to all access the same speaker. It would be most ideal for everyone to be able to queue and control the music from their personal devices, rather than from one device or one service.

### Project Overview: 
The Modern Jukebox is a Raspberry Pi controlled by a React webapp. This application allows one user to “Create a Session” by signing into Spotify, then other users to “Join a Session” to queue songs to the device. Users joining the session don’t need a Spotify login, effectively allowing anyone with the session ID to queue songs and control the playback. 

### Current Build: Release Candidate
